# Movie Industry Analysis
This project is a set of real world data science practice from data cleaning, changing data types, data cleaning, EDA, to data visualization using **Python**. We are going to analyze and find insights as much we can get from the Movie Industry Data from IMDB. A Question that came in my mind while analyzing this project is, "Is the Movie Industry Really Dying? Because of Netflix, Prime, and other streaming platforms."

## Dataset
